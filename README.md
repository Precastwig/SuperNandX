Noughts and crosses just souped up and actually fun. Made in java with swing.

Currently you can play the game to completion, with mouse and/or keyboard.
Keyboard controls are:
arrow keys and wasd = move selection reticule
space = choose spot
c = computer move (currently just picks totally randomly from the available choices)

To do (in order of doing):
- New game functionality
- Basic AI (based on chess robits? need an evaluation method for board states) / neural nets!??!?!? @mishawagner
- Main menu
- Online connectivity
- Chess clock
Things i will probably never get around to but sound like good ideas:
- Animations
- Options (colour, size)
- Multithreaded
