Noughts and crosses just souped up and actually fun. Made in java with swing.

Currently you can play the game to completion, with mouse and/or keyboard.

Keyboard controls are:

arrow keys and wasd = move selection reticule

space = choose spot

c = computer move (makes choices based on an evaluation function using alpha-beta pruning)

To do (in order of doing):
- Main menu
- Online connectivity (Jpopup doesn't want to work)
- Chess clock
- Multithreaded (for AI evauluation)

Things i will probably never get around to but sound like good ideas:
- Neural network version of AI @Mishawagner
- Animations
- Options (colour, size)
