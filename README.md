# SuperNandX
Noughts and crosses just souped up and actually fun. Made in java with swing.

Currently you can play the game to completion, with mouse and/or keyboard.

## Keyboard controls

arrow keys and wasd = move selection reticule

space = choose spot

c = computer move (makes choices based on an evaluation function using alpha-beta pruning, depth of evaluation decided by UI slider)

## To do (in order of doing):
- Animations (Exciting)
- Main menu <- Maybe i dont need one? seems pointless
- Online connectivity (UI elements started)
- Chess clock
- Multithreaded (for AI evaluation so UI doesn't hang)

## Things i will probably never get around to but sound like good ideas:
- Neural network version of AI @Mishawagner
- Options (colour, size)
